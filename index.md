# Paragraph of text with line break
To create a line break or new line, end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.  
Like this.  
This actually works.  
<!-- Example of another paragraph -->
You can also use some of html <br> Does this work? <br> Yes!<br>Is it a new line?<br> Yes! <p> Is it a new paragraph? <br> Yes!</p>

# Emphasis  
## Bold    
To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase.   
It **really** works. Use the one __you__ like.   
But it's better to use asterisks if you want to bold some part of a word. Like finding some art in your own name: M**art**a. See?
## Italics    
To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase.  
And just like *that* you've got yourself _italics_.    
It works in the middle of a word too. M*art*a. 
## Bold and italics
That's simple! One asterisk for italics, two for bold... Add them up and ***there you go***. ___Three underscores___ will do the job as well. 
## Crossing out
Use double tilde to show how much you don't like something.  

For example, Rick Astley would:  
tell you how he is feeling  
~~give you up  
let you down  
run around and desert you~~  

  
# Links and images  

## Links 
You can insert some external links for [additional info](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&ab_channel=RickAstley)
Or add a link to [another file](exercise.md)  

## Images
You can add images from your drive  

![obrazek](./images/unnamed.jpg)  

or from the internet   
![picsum](https://picsum.photos/id/237/200/300)  
  
You can also include an image with hover text. Any text you want.

<!-- Example of equation or inline code -->  
# Maths

I don't really know how this one works. I know you have to use a dollar sign on both ends.    

$\sqrt{4x-1}=5$ 


<!-- Example of a block of code -->
# Block of code

Use three backticks at both ends.

```   
<p> Here's where HTML won't work.  
Or <b>will</b> it?   
```
Let's try the same without three backticks: <p> Here's where HTML won't work.  
Or <b>will</b> it?   

<!-- Example of code highlighting -->
# Code highlighting  

You mean this?
```html   
<p> Here's where HTML won't work.  
Or <b>will</b> it?   
```

<!-- Example of quote -->

# Quote  
You can add some blockquotes just by using the ending angle brackets:  
>*If you want to receive emails about my upcoming shows, please give me money so I can buy a computer.* - Phoebe Buffay  


<!-- Example of bullet list -->

# Lists   
## Bullet lists  
You can make lists simply by putting '-' in front of each line:  
- first item
- second item
- third item
## Numbered lists
You can make a numbered list, by starting each line with a number and a dot:
1. one
2. two
3. four
4. ha

The funny part is that numbers don't have to be in order, as long as you start with '1':  
1. what happens now
9. fun  
1. one 

<!-- Example of numbered list -->  
  
<!-- Example of table -->  

# Columns
You can transform a text into a column just by adding some '|' and '-'

Look! 

"I'm not great at advice. But can I interest you in a sarcastic comment?" - Chandler Bing   


| I'm | not great   | at advice. |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| But   | can I | interest    |
| you  | in          | a        |
| sarcastic    | comment         | ?           |  
  
And when you are done with the column you can write whatever you want again.   

  
    



THE END
